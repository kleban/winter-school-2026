  + How many family members lived in a house
- years_liv
  + How many years respondent has lived in village or neighbouring village
- respondent_wall_type
  + Type of wall of house
- rooms
  + Number of rooms in house


```{r echo=F, message=F}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs)) %>%
    knitr::kable(caption = "We can also add a caption.", 
               col.names = c("Village", "Member Association", 
                             "Mean Number of Members"))
```

```{r echo=F}
library(ggthemes)

interviews_plotting <- read_csv("data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")

percent_items <- interviews_plotting %>%
  group_by(village) %>%
  summarize(across(bicycle:no_listed_items, ~ sum(.x) / n() * 100)) %>%
  pivot_longer(bicycle:no_listed_items, names_to = "items", values_to = "percent")
percent_items

percent_items %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = village)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ items) +
  labs(title = "Percent of respondents in each village who owned each item",
       x = "Village",
       y = "Percent of Respondents") +
  theme_excel_new() +
  scale_fill_excel_new()

```

```{r}
data <- interviews |>
  select(village) |>
  group_by(village) |>
  summarise(count = n())
data
```
In village **Chirodzo** live `r data |> filter(village == "Chirodzo") |> select(count)` people.
